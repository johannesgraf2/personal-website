Hello! I'm Johannes Graf from LÃ¶rrach, situated between the two beatiful cities of Basel and Freiburg.

I'm a dedicated, goal-oriented, time punctual individual who thrives on transforming challenges into successful, tangible outcomes.

I pursued my Bachelor Degree in Business Administration from the International Universtiy of Applied Science https://www.iu.de/

My Master's studies in Information Systems at the University of Liechtenstein are focused on applying cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Data Science techniques to solve complex business challenges.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
